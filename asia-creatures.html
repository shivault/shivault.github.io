					<p>This creature came into public knowledge around 2002, after rumours started to circulate on a Japanese forum wedbsite known as 2Channel. They say that members of a whale research ship spotted this creature in the waves near the Antarctic coast, but it vanished before any further investigating could be done. There have been various "sightings", those being from Google Earth or deep sea cameras, but nothing as been proven. I find this one hard to beleive in, as the concept of such a creature only came up during 2002, and there is no real evidence besides some shaky theories.</p>

						<p>Serpents have always played a influential role in Chinese mythology. They were seen as benevolent and were associated with natural elements such as the wind and rivers. They often have supernatural abilities such as shape shifting, various deities also have snakelike qualities. The snake is also one of the signs in the Chinese Zodiac. These long floating objects have been seen in China, and I haven't found a good explanation for what they are. Some say it has something to do with bats, other say it is plastic/garbage, and there are theroies that it is a bundle of micro-organisms that form a large creature. None of these theories make a lot of sense and there are a lot of pictures of this phenomonon, and they are all found only in China. Reports of large flying serpent-like creatures can be found throughout almost all of China's history, and these photos only add to the mystery.</p>

							<p>Jinn are spirits from the Middle East. They are prominent in both pre and post Islamic mythology and religion. They are usually described as either being benign and harmless to humans, more commonly, dangerous and malevolent spirits. They are often known as Demons, and closely associated with Darkness, Black Cobras, and Sleep Paralysis. Within rural Middle Eastern communities, stories of Jinn are still told and sightings/paranormal experiences still occur.</p>
