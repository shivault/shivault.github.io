		<p>The finmen, also known as the Finfolk, come from the history of the Orkney Islands, in Scotland. They are a race of nomadic sorcerers and master boatsman. They were known for spiriting away mortals and transportin them to hidden island homes of the Finmen. Their malevolent intetions often explained the many dissapearances and deaths of fishermen at sea. When Christianity came to the Island, the Finmen stopped showing up, the natives of Orkney said that they could not stand to hear the gospel, and despised modern fishing practices.</p>

			<p>Also from Orcadian folklore, the Nuckelavee is a horse like demon. It is the torso of a man atop the body of a horse. It lacks skin and has a powerful stench, which makes plants and animals die and whither when they are near the beast. It lives in the sea, but may come upon land if it is angered (some say the burning of kelp causes it to seek out and punish the perpetrator, as it hates the smell). It however, cannot come into contact with fresh water, as it burns the creature. The creature was also talked about in Scandanavia as well.</p>

				<p>The Banshee is a malevolent spirit from Ireland. It heralds the death of a family member by screaming, wailing, shrieking, or keening (A traditional form of lamentation amongst Gaelic/Celtic communities). They are said to be connected to "tumuli" (Mounds) that are found all throughout the Irish countryside. Banshees are said to have a ghastly pale complexion, and long flowing red hair. Their eyes are red from continuous weeping, and they wear a grey cloak over a green dress.</p>

					<p>An ancient European beast. It is said to be a reptile, the King of the Serpents. It has the power to instantly kill any man who dares to look it in the eye. It may be related to the Cocaktrice. Some stories say it has the ability to breathe fire, or that it has a poisonous breath. What is most interesting about this creature is that it is said to be real, according to Pliny The Elder's "Natural History" which was written in 79 AD. The basilisk is also closely tied to alchemy. Theophilus Pesbyter said that it was possible to turn copper into gold by combing it with powdered basilisk blood, powdered human blood, red copper, and a certain type of vinegar. The basilisk is also included in Leonardo Da Vinci's beastiary. If such a creature never existed, why was it spoken of so often all throughout Europe over thousands of years?</p>
