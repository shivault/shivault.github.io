				<p>Werewolves, we all know what they are, but the idea of them being called "Dogmen" and being native to North America is quite strange. The idea that Dogmen exist isn't a new one, and it is actually quite popular. Apparently Dogman are meant to be a sort of human dog hyprid, while others say that they are actually werewolves. They are found mostly in the Midwest (and other rural regions) of America and Canada. I guess Mexico is a bit too hot for them. Their eyes glow in the dark, and they are reported to be hostile and aggressive. The most interesting part about this creature is that there have been many sightings throughout a fairly long time period, much like Bigfoot. Many people have come forth with stories that are believable.</p>

					<p>The thunderbird is a creature that is found in the folklore of Native American people. It is said to cause thunder when it flies and flaps its wings. It is found in many Native American myths throughout all of America, and there have been sightings of a massive bird from both Native Americans and modern day people. During tornadoes that occur in the midwest, some people say that they say the silhouette of a massive bird in the sky.</p>

							<p>The Jersey Devil is said to lurk within the Pine Barrens. The Pine Barrens are a very thick stretch of forest within New Jersey. Legend has it that in the 1800s a woman had 12 children, and when she had her 13th, she cried "Let it be the Devil!" As such, the Jersey Devil was spawned.</p>

									<p>This story is strange. The creature looks very fantastical, which makes it unlikely, but the story itself seems to make sense. The gist of the story is that some schoolchildren (middle and high school) saw what they described as a comet crash in the large property of neighbours farm. So they got a flashlight and went through the woods to the location of the crash. They then saw this frankly terrifying creature in the night. There is a lot of speculation of what happened that night, with the most commonly held paranormal theory being that it was a crashed alien spaceship, while the most common logical explanation being that it was simply an owl that's shadow was very large due to the light of the flashlight. </p>
